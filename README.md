###Version Control
####Questions

>Why would you want to version control your code?

A: Version control is important to use because it tracks all of the changes that you commit and allows you to recall earlier versions at any time. This can be helpful when issues arise when writing new code.

> Where can you find additional information about the Git commands available?

A: More information about Git commands can be found in the GitHub resources: https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf

>Why are branches useful?

A: Branches are helpful because they allow you to work on code without making changes to the master file immediately. Branches allow multiple people to work on different aspects of the same sections of code with the ability to merge all changes made into the original code.

>What is the purpose of a remote?

A: A remote allows you to have a local copy of a repository on your computer. Changes that are made on the local copy can then be pushed to the remote repository.

>Why is it important to track changes to the upstream repository after you create your initial fork?

A: It is important to track upstream changes because it allows you to see the contributions that are being made by other users which may ultimately affect your work. Fetching allows you to monitor the changes without merging them into your local copy until necessary.
